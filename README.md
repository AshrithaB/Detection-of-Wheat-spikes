## Overview

Detection of Wheat Spikes is a computer vision project aimed at revolutionizing the way farmers monitor and manage their wheat crops. Agriculture, being a vital source of income for many developing countries, depends heavily on the success of wheat cultivation. This project leverages computer vision techniques to help farmers by automatically detecting and tracking wheat spikes in the fields. Wheat spikes are essential as they represent the grains that are harvested, making their precise monitoring crucial for optimizing yields.

The main objectives of this project are:

- To create a robust object detection model that can efficiently identify wheat heads.
- To develop a generalized model that works with data from different parts of the world.
- To utilize advanced object detection algorithms such as Faster R-CNN and YOLO for accurate and real-time detection.

With the recent advancements in computer vision, deep learning, and neural networks, this project aims to provide farmers with a valuable tool to streamline their wheat cultivation processes.

The website provides comprehensive information about the project, implementation such as data acquisition, pre-processing, post-processing. Additionally, it presents the results obtained using our object detection model, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying wheat spikes in agricultural fields. Please visit the website to learn more about the project and its contributions to the field of agriculture and computer vision.
