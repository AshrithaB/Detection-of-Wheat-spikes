## Overview

Detection of Wheat Spikes is a computer vision project aimed at revolutionizing the way farmers monitor and manage their wheat crops. Agriculture, being a vital source of income for many developing countries, depends heavily on the success of wheat cultivation. This project leverages computer vision techniques to help farmers by automatically detecting and tracking wheat spikes in the fields. Wheat spikes are essential as they represent the grains that are harvested, making their precise monitoring crucial for optimizing yields.

The main objectives of this project are:

- To create a robust object detection model that can efficiently identify wheat heads.
- To develop a generalized model that works with data from different parts of the world.
- To utilize advanced object detection algorithms such as Faster R-CNN and YOLO for accurate and real-time detection.

With the recent advancements in computer vision, deep learning, and neural networks, this project aims to provide farmers with a valuable tool to streamline their wheat cultivation processes.

## Features

- **Wheat Spike Detection:** The project uses state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to accurately identify and track wheat spikes in fields.

- **Generalization:** The model is designed to work with data from diverse geographical locations, making it versatile for various farming environments.

- **Efficiency:** Leveraging Faster R-CNN and YOLO, the model provides fast and accurate spike detection, enabling real-time monitoring.
